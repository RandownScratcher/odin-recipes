    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g potatos</li>
        <li>150g onions</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>250ml olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and dice potatoes into small (0.5 - 1 cm) cubes, sprinkle with a level teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Heat approximately 250 ml of olive oil in a 24 cm diameter pan, add potato cubes. Potatoes should be just covered with oil. Reduce heat to medium and fry potatoes for about 12 - 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finely chop onions and saut√© in a second pan with a little olive oil until translucent and golden brown in 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs into a large bowl, beat vigorously with a whisk, and add salt.</li>
        <li>Strain potatoes from olive oil using a sieve. Add potatoes and onions to the eggs in the bowl and let it sit for 3 - 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 - 3 tablespoons of olive oil, pour the tortilla mixture into the pan, and fry for 2 minutes. When the mixture starts to brown (do not let the eggs set), flip the tortilla using a plate.</li>
        <li>Simply place the plate on the tortilla and flip the pan so that the tortilla is on the plate. Then slide the tortilla back into the pan. Fry for 1 minute on the other side. The tortilla should be still liquid inside.</li>
        <li>Serve with bread or salad as side dishes.</li>
        
    </ol>
